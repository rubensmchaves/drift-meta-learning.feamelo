# Drift meta learning

Master's thesis in Computer Science at the University of Brasília ([PPGI](http://ppgi.unb.br)).

The objective is to perform drift detection using meta learning by predicting the performance of a base model (regression or classification) with unknown target.

## 2. Running
To work on this project is important to read the git good practive guide first, [here](https://github.com/rubensmchaves/drift-meta-learning.feamelo/blob/main/git_good_practice.md).

1. Set a local environment, using `venv` module. Check the W3School tutorial [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_virtualenv.asp).
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Run the project locally.
